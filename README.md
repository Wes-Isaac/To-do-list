# To Do list

In this project, I built a simple HTML list of To Do tasks. The list is styled according to this [template](https://web.archive.org/web/20180320194056/http://www.getminimalist.com:80/). This simple web page was built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

Clone the repo to your local machine. Run this command

git clone https://github.com/Wes-Isaac/To-do-list.git

cd To-do-list

Navigate to To-do-list folder/directory. At the project's root, on the terminal, run 'npm install' to install app dependencies

Next, run 'npm start' which will run the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

ALTERNATIVELY

Just run 'npm run build' which will build the project and generate output files into the build directory.

Go to build directory and manually open index.html to interact with the app.
